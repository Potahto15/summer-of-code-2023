<strong>Observe how the page is divided into nested elements. Check if it forms a tree structure.</strong><br/>
<p>Every web page is divided into nested elements, forming a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the HTML structure of a webpage and provides a hierarchical representation of the elements on the page.</p>
<p>The DOM tree is formed by parent-child relationships between elements. Each HTML element, such as &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, etc., is represented as a node in the DOM tree. The top-level node in the tree is the <html> element, which contains the entire webpage.</p>
<p>The child nodes are nested within their parent nodes, creating a hierarchical structure. <br/>
We can observe this tree-like structure on Moodle's home page as well.</p>

<p>Here, with the highlighted text we can clearly see a formation of a tree, for example, the body element is the parent of the div  </p>
<p> So the tree I think is as follows:</p>
<p>&lt;html&gt;<br/>
-&lt;head&gt;<br/>
--&lt;body&gt;<br/>
---&lt;div&gt;<br/>
.....so on</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Try to edit the properties of elements and see how that changes the way the page looks.</strong></p>
